    "goal": "Mobile application for devices with Android that allows reading quotes from the greatest minds in history. CMS for adding and modyfing data consumed by mobile application. RESTful service that serves as a source of data for both of the above mentioned.",
    "description": "RESTful service is written in Java, using Spring Boot. CMS was created in pure JavaScript. It was my first JavaScript application, so I figured out that writing everything from scratch is a great idea to learn it. It has very simple UI and does not handle well different screen resolutions. Modyfing content that mobile app consumes is its only use and it serves this goal well. Mobile app is the most important component of the project and at the same time the only one that matters to the end user. It is a native Android application written in Java. Its primary objective is to allow reading quotes in the most comfortable and encouraging way possible. All of its data come from the backend, which is downloaded at the moment of installation and saved locally to SQLite database. From from that time data is synchronized on a weekly basis. Thanks to that approach internet connection is not needed most of the time.",
