    <div class="about">
        <p class="indented fade-in-first-delay"> My road to finally become a programmer was quite long. I always had a
            problem of having too many interests. I
            studied Psychology, Food Technology and Electronics
            and did not finish any of them, searching for the domain to which I will want to commit for the long haul.
            In
            the meantime, I held various odd jobs. I worked in construction,
            paper carton production, electronics production, on a peony plantation, as a postman, bodyguard in the
            shopping
            center and a warehouseman. Being interested in subjects as different
            as philosophy, history, weightlifting, dietetics and engineering or hard sciences I had to try various
            things to
            find what fits my character and abilities best. In 2017, after year of studying Electronics
            at the Lodz University of Technology I got a programming internship at Inovatica in Lodz. Already before
            that
            opportunity I developed fondness for programming. I did well there,
            so I took the risk, negotiated and got employed at the end of the internship. I dropped out of university
            and
            created rigorous plan of learning, which I had been executing religiously since then.</p>
        <div></div>
        <p class="indented fade-in-second-delay">From September 2017 I have been working as a programmer at Inovatica in
            Lodz. At the very begining I was only
            developing native Android applications. Then I was creatingx
            backend in Java using Spring and Hibernate. There was a period in which I was working on very customized and
            domain specific Java applications that interacts with <a href="http://www.ros.org/" target="_blank">ROS</a>.
            At the moment, I am working on mobile apps again using Kotlin. Programming is my greatest passion, so I am
            always learning something related to it and working on various projects. <a href="/">Documenting</a> them
            is the main goal of this website.
            I consider myself a programmer, not only web, desktop or mobile one. Most of my experience is related to
            mobile
            and web development <a href="/skills">using</a> Java and JavaScript related technologies, but I am happy
            to work in
            every domain related to programming applying technology that you find the most suitable.</p>
